## Functionality of the POET Tool

The Partially Ordered Trace Extractor Tool (POET) detects concurrencies among the activities/events in the event log provided as .xes file. In its current version, it detects concurrency using the so-called "alpha" or lifecycle oracles, and it can detect and apply concurrency on activity level (logwise) or on event level (tracewise), selectable by the "mode" and "scope" parameters. In lifecycle oracle mode, all events occurring in between a start-activity and its first matching complete-activity are considered concurrent to the interval-defining activity. It then transforms the sequential traces of the log to partially ordered traces. Isomorphs among the partially ordered trace variants are identified using the VF2++ algorithm.<br><br>
POET can be used to analyze concurrencies in the log only, or to additionally export a partially ordered log.<br><br>
Partial order information is added to the .xes output file as follows:

- A unique ID is added to every event using the key "identifier:id", example:

```
<int key="identity:id" value="0" />
```

- The successor nodes (events) of an event in the partial order are added on event level using the key "po_successors", which lists the successors' IDs as values of its children. Please note that events that are part of the partial order but have no successors (they may even be isolated nodes) nevertheless have a list of successors, which is empty. Events which are not part of the partial order but part of the sequential trace (e.g. start activities) have a "nan" value as po_successor list. Example for an event which has successors with IDs 1, 2 and 3:

```
  <list key="po_successors">
    <values>
     <string key="0" value="11" />
     <string key="1" value="12" />
     <string key="2" value="15" />
    </values>
   </list>
```

- The partial order variant number is added on trace level using the key "po_name", example:

```
  <float key="po_name" value="1.0" />
```

- In case of a reduction of the log, the combined multiplicities of the cases represented by a trace in the log is added on trace level using the key "multiplicity", example:

```
 <float key="multiplicity" value="3.0" />
```
